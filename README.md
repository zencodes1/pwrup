# pwrup
A future package manager for Windows 7+!
# Concept
1. Compress the app files in a zip file
2. Distribute the app via internet or locally.
3. Run "pwrup install .\pwrapp.zip" in the destination computer.
4. The pwrapp will be installed in C:\Users\USERNAME\AppData\Local\PwrUp\Apps\NameOfPwrApp\Binaries\
# ETA
This is just a concept, pwrup will probably be created in a future.
